# Verilog Practice ðŸš€

This repository contains Verilog modules and their corresponding testbenches for digital design practice. The goal is to strengthen design and simulation skills using tools like EDA Playground.

## Folder Structure

- **designs/**: Contains Verilog design files.
- **testbenches/**: Contains testbench files for simulation.

## Platfrom used
Designed and simulated on [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/) using Icarus Verilog.

## Upcoming
- 4x1 MUX
- Decoder
- Flip-flops
- Counters
